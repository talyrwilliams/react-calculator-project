## Business Requirement

A calculator application that can perform standard and scientific calculations.

## User Stories
As a student,
I want to be able to perform standard and scientific calculations on one application,
So that I can solve problems beyond basic math with just one tool.

Given the user needs to perform a basic calculation,
When the user inputs the calculation and press calculate/equals
Then the calculation should complete
Then the answer should display

Given the user needs to perform a scientific calculation,   
When the user clicks the "Scientific" button   
Then the user shall be able to view the calculator in Scientific mode   
Then the user will be able to input scientific calculations and press calculate/equals  
Then the calculation should complete
Then the answer should display

## Functional Requirements

FR01: A user can view the calculator in Standard mode   
FR02: A user can view the calculator in Scientific mode   
FR03: A user can toggle between Standard and Scientific mode   
FR04: The system should change the color of the button when the user hovers the mouse over the button
